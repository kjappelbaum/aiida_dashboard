#AiiDA Dashboard

Here I try around to create an AiiDA dashboard. First goal is to list a few 
statistics about current and past calculations (to have a nice visualization 
of how my jobs do). 

Then, I'd like to add a interface in which one can select pks in the table and
call verdi commands on them. 


Maybe, one could then add another page with a query builder interface.
